### I'm Chris.

#### An engineer, technology enthusiast, developer, hacker/maker, and more...

I love to build, prototype and develop new things using skills in design, electronics, fabrication, machining and mechanical & software engineering. I do this both as a hobby and at [balena](https://github.com/balena-io/) (which is awesome!).

When I get time, I like to travel, [ride my bike](https://www.strava.com/athletes/4584726), [play pinball](https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=2691), watch movies and [try new beers](https://untappd.com/user/chrisys) with friends.
